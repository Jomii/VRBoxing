- √ next target preview
- √ hand models
- increase hand size to prevent controllers crashing together irl
- steps 1s -> 0.5s interval? 1 hit per second feels slow
- better combos (symmetry and try general combos)
- score system
- pause
- button to return to menu

notes:
lack of hand rotation visibility sucks
gameplay felt slow, annoying that you have to react to targets, because you dont know what is coming next so its impossible to set up combos that feel good
it was noticeable that the targets were attempting to fit the song, but they felt unsynced which was dissapointin - maybe make better general combos and play song in bg OR make in sync levels
