# VRBoxing
Scrapped VR-game idea, where the player would punch boxing targets to the rythm of music.

## Project highlights:
- Made a functioning VR application.
  - Solved several issues related to Unity and the Oculus VR framework -package.
  - Use of Android Debug Bridge (ADB) for troubleshooting issues with the app running on the Oculus Quest headset.
- Created a spawning system for the boxing target that could be used dynamically.
- Integrated a separate package into the project for the VR hand models.
